1.00 - Aug 22 2012
    - Fix implicit and explicit destructors for context and sockets.
      (https://github.com/lestrrat/p5-ZMQ/issues/11), spotted by @melo

      Previously this threw an assertion:

        my $ctxt = zmq_init();
        my $pid = fork();
        exit(0) unless $pid;
        waitpid($pid, 0);

     This is because $ctxt was being freed on both the child and the parent.

     As of this version, we make sure that behind the scenes the context 
     can only be freed in the process and thread that it was created in.
     Likewise sockets can only be freed within the same process.

1.00_03 - Apr 23 2012
    - Changed zmq_poll()'s return value. In list context, you can get the
      array of boolean values indicating if the particular socket got fired

        my @fired = zmq_poll(...);

      In scalar context, you get the return value of zmq_poll() from the C
      layer

        my $rv = zmq_poll(...)

    - Fix getsockopt_string()

1.00_02 - Mar 26 2012
    - Beef up the docs extensively.
    - Make sure to set $! upo failure
    - Add author tests
    - Change zmq_sendmsg to a pure perl method.
    - Make sure to emulate libzmq2 errors for stuff like trying to act upon
      closed cxt, sockets, and messages, since we don't call the C level
      functions when we detect that they have been closed from the Perl level.


1.00_01 - Mar 24 2012
    - Initial release.
